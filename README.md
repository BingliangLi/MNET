# MNET
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper "A Brand New Dance Partner:Music-Conditioned Pluralistic Dancing Synthesized by Multiple Dance Genres", CVPR 2022


## Examples

## Framework
We propose MNET, a novel and scalable approach that can perform music-conditioned pluralistic dance generation synthesized by multiple dance genres using only a single model. Here, we learn a dance-genre aware latent representation by training a conditional generative adversarial network leveraging Transformer architecture.
